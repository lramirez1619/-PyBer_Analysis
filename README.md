## Summary:
Rural may have the least total rides, drivers, and fares but it has the highest average fare per ride and per driver. The information suggests that the passangers does not often take advantage of the service; however, when they do, it is for a longer distance.
Urban is in the middle in all fields.
Urban generates the most rides, drivers, and fares but it has the lowest average fare per ride driver. The information suggests that the passangers often take advantage of the service; however, when they do, it is for short distance.
